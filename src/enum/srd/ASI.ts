export const ASI = `At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability	Score Improvement feature. You can do either of: 

*1) Increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.* 
\nAs normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

*2) Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead.* 
\nYou can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.
\nYou must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.`;
