# Morii VTT [![CI](https://github.com/Ashmogh/morii-vtt/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Ashmogh/morii-vtt/actions/workflows/main.yml)
Morii is web-based half-vtt for playing 5E. It features campaign management and live games with chat, dice rolling and character sheets with fully incorporated roll sending. 

New character can be created either manually from scratch, or with quick-create (which has all the 5E SRD Classes, Races, Spells and Equipment, see Licenses) or imported from roll20 character sheet .json files.
