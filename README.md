# Morii VTT [![CI](https://github.com/Ashmogh/morii-vtt/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Ashmogh/morii-vtt/actions/workflows/main.yml)
Morii is a web-based half-vtt for playing 5E.

## Key Features
- **Campaign Management** - Create, destroy and join campaigns, invite your great players, kick the not so great ones.
- **Live Games** - See your character sheet, send messages to fellow players, roll some dice using MersenneTwister for great randomness (I)
- **Game Overview for GMs** - All character/NPC sheets in one place, with initiative tracker and simple ordered views of characters' armor class and passive perceptions
- **Character sheets** - With all the things you would expect from normal 5E sheets, fully incorporated rolling and mooaar
- **Quick-Create** - Create your new character *blazingly fast* with 5E SRD Classes, Races, Spells and Equipment included (II)
- **Import/Export** - Import your characters exported from roll20 using the [VTTES](https://github.com/justas-d/roll20-enhancement-suite) plugin. Import/export them into simple .json files or between campaigns/players.

As a bonus, you can swear or w/e at other players in dwarvish/elvish/gnomish (using e.g. /l dwarvish --- in chat) and none will know. (III)

**With all that aside**, this project is still actively developed, and as such expect some rough edges here and there. If you have any issues, encounter bugs, or have some general feedback etc., feel free to start a new issue or reach out directly.

(I) All nat 1s are non refundable.\
(II) As there are no subclasses/backgrounds under the OGL you will sadly still have to import these manually.\
(III) Unless they are the GM or know dwarvish.
